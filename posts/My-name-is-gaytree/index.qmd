## Introduction

#### This is a ridiculous class.

kidding, i am damn excited about this class. Arvind is being annoying. There are hardly any switch boards in this class

#### My First piece of R-code after a long time:)

 i am damn tired  lol

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)

```

```{r}
babynames
```

```{r}
babynames %>%  filter(name == "Gayatri")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name== "Gayatri") %>% gf_line(n~ year)

```

Too many gayatri's were born in the US between 2005 and 2008:) And i wasn't one of them , I was born in Pune!

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name== "Gayathri") %>% gf_line(n~ year)
```

```{r}
babynames %>%  filter(name == "Gayatri"|name == "Gayathri")
```

```{r}
babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Gayatri" | name == "Gayathri") %>%
  gf_bar(n ~ year, fill = ~ name)
```
